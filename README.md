# Snake Game

## Description
Welcome to the classic Snake Game! This Python-based project utilizes the pygame library to bring the nostalgia of the timeless Snake game to life. Control a snake as it navigates the game board, consuming food to grow longer. Be cautious and avoid running into the walls or colliding with yourself, as this will result in the game ending. Your objective is to achieve the highest score possible by eating as much food as you can without colliding.
